# ScaleDynamics - WarpJS Samples

This repository contains a collection of samples using the [WarpJS](https://docs.scaledynamics.com/) technology, for the [ScaleDynamics](https://scaledynamics.com) platform.

## What is WarpJS?

WarpJS SDK is a unique technology created by ScaleDynamics to code and call microservices as fast as simple JavaScript modules. Built for production grade projects, it provides everything to develop and deploy from small to large projects, directly from a laptop, with a unique development experience and at light speed.

It is connected to our SaaS which provides the development team everything needed to go to any cloud (or on-premise), transparently with zero DevOps skills or infrastructure knowledge.

You can test a live version of the WarpJS SDK on the [JavaScript Playground](https://playground.scaledynamics.cloud/). It allows coding directly from the browser both front-end and back-end snippets, running the preview in real time.
